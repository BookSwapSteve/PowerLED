This project ia a Home Automation solution for controlling LED lighting using a Netduino or Meridian/P

Aims:
	Enabled the control of multiple high power (1 or 3 Watt) LEDs.
	Controlled via a network adaptor (or possible other local solution).
	Additional sensors on the device to make it a little more interesting.
	If possible to use POE (802.3af) to power the LEDs.

Hardware:
	Netduino (not network capable so aim for Netduino Plus when released)
	or Meridian/P (no analog input so limited sensor config) and requires network module.

Framework:
	Using .NET Micro Framework 4.1 and VS2010 for development.
